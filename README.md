### <a name="whoami">Who Am I</a>
---

#### + Laboratory scientist
I was a Biomedical scientist specialised in cancer research.
I wonder how things work, and this has always been the drive of my life. This is why Biology fascinates me. It is an ultimate study of how we work - how life works.

#### + Turned developer
Then in coding, I re-discovered an ideal place to explore my curiosity and creativity. I have found few things to date that provide this degree of freedom and satisfaction coding offers.

Recently, I created [Japanesify](https://japanesify.herokuapp.com/) at Makers Academy. It is an [open-source](https://github.com/MisaOgura/japanesify.git) web application that converts names into Japanese characters. It has become popular within the organisation and many started to use their Japanese names in slack channels. Even such a small change in people's lives brought me a tremendous joy!

#### + What's next ?
I am currently looking for a role that will allow me to further grow as a changemaker. I thrive in an environment where I will be constantly challenged to push boundaries of my knowledge and skills. My particular interests are in creating multi-platform software that is easy and fun to navigate and satisfies usersâ€™ needs and curiosities.

### <a name="skills">Key Skills</a>
---

#### + Adaptable communicator
Having lived away from home since young, I have naturally developed independency and interpersonal adaptability.

At Makers Academy, I pair-programmed every day with different persons. In addition, working on group projects following agile principles further helped me improve as a confident communicator.

Also, having worked as an academic tutor for A-level and university-level students, I am able to :
+ simplify complicated concepts with real-life examples
+ carefully adjust conversations according to personality
+ yet still be assertive of problems and priorities

#### + Logical thinker
As a laboratory scientist, I have developed the ability to think logically and approach problems from multiple perspectives, which can be applied to any tasks at hands.

Logical thinking allows me to :
+ grasp a big picture of the problem space
+ identify and separate problems
+ create & test hypotheses
+ repeat the process to narrow down causes/solutions

#### + Determined problem-solver
Perseverance and patience, combined with logical thinking, make me a determined problem-solver who never gives up, but also knows when to step back for a break. In fact, **debugging** is my favourite bit in software development!

Biomedical research often takes months to appreciate results. The data acquired is often ambiguous due to the nature of the subject, therefore I have developed a great degree of patience and serendipity towards problems in general.

The fast cycle of hypothesis testing in coding is such a satisfying process. I get to see the result of what I do straight away in black and white. And this is one of many reasons I love coding.

#### + <a name="projects">Passionate self-driven learner</a>
Always on a hunt for pursuing new knowledge and technologies.

From a complete beginner in coding, I have produced [over 15 projects](https://github.com/MisaOgura?tab=repositories) independently and collaboratively, all completed under very tight time constraints at Makers Academy. Below are selected projects listed in a chronological order to demonstrate the increasing complexity of the projects.

| Project - link to repo | Completion time | Summary | Key technologies |
| ---------------------- | :-------------: | :-----: | ---------------: |
| [Chitter](https://github.com/MisaOgura/chitter-challenge) | 2 days | A twitter clone with basic functionality to post peeps and comments. Available on Heroku: [Chitter](https://chitter-app-misa.herokuapp.com/users/new) |  Ruby, Sinatra, DataMapper, PostgreSQL, RESTful API. Tested with RSpec, Capybara. |
| [Github Grabber](https://github.com/MisaOgura/github-grabber) | 2 days | A single page responsive web application for requesting Github profiles based on usernames. Available on Heroku: [Github Grabber](https://github-grabber.herokuapp.com/) | AngularJS, Node.js, RESTful API, Github API. |
| [Japanesify](https://github.com/MisaOgura/japanesify.git) | 1 week | A single page responsive web application that converts your names to Japanese characters. Available on Heroku: [Japanesify](https://japanesify.herokuapp.com/) | AngularJS, regex-based conversion algorithm. Tested with Karma and Protractor. |
| LEAVE [Frontend](https://github.com/MisaOgura/leave-frontend.git) [Backend](https://github.com/MisaOgura/leave-backend.git) | 2 weeks | A mobile application to help planning journeys depending on tube disruptions and weather conditions. | Ionic, Ruby on Rails, RESTful API, 3rd party APIs. Tested with Rspec, Karma and Protractor. |

### <a name="passion">Other Things I Am Passionate About</a>
---

#### + Travel

I am a keen traveler. Countries I have been to include :
+ Australia
+ Canada
+ China
+ England
+ France
+ Finland
+ Germany
+ Iceland
+ Italy
+ Switzerland

I prefer traveling alone, because it allows me to immerse myself fully into the culture and people. I am enthusiastic about randomly starting conversations with fellow travelers and locals, listening to their stories and sharing mine.

The USA, South America and Africa are on the top of my list as the next destinations!

#### + Reading

My favourites are fantasy and Sci-Fi novels.

Reading, to me, is another form of travel. When I read, I live through the stories. I feel what characters feel, think, see, smell and taste.

I love travelling the real world but sometimes books are just better with flying cars, riding on a dragon's back, reaching to another solar system in a second and flying with your umbrella!

My absolute favourite of all time is _**Hard-Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World**_ by **Haruki Murakami**. The seemingly unrelated two worlds are beautifully and witfully told in parallel. From the moment the link unfolds to the climax, it is an emotional rollercoaster. He shakes your feelings, makes you question what you know about the worlds and will leave you empty and yet in an awe of his pure genius. Highly recommended!

#### + Scuba Diving

I am an **Advanced Open Water Diver** certified by Professional Association of Diving Instructors ( PADI ), the world largest recreational diving membership and diver training organisation. The most important thing I *unexpectedly* learnt from scuba diving is to **trust and let go**.

Imagine... you are 30m below water. The sun gradually fades away as you descend farther. The water gives a chill to your spine. There is absolutely no sound, apart from the mechanical whizz and bursting bubbles as you inhale and exhale.

Now you are at 40m.

And you suddenly feel the weight of the reality, that your life relies *solely* on this thin line of oxygen in this remote world of underwater. Slight panic starts to take over. " No no, calm down, it's fine, everything's fine... " Your chest is knocking and you feel breathless. The urge to ascend swallows your reason...

But then you realise *- I'm not alone -* No, you have your buddy ( divers are required to dive always in a pair ). A buddy is a person you trust, and it better be. Because when the panic takes over in the most vulnerable situation, it's that trust for your buddy that brings your heart rate back and scrub your fear away.

Trust and let go : it's not always easy, but I've developed this mentality through scuba diving.
